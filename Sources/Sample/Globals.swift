/// To do this, select the `TicTacFishServer` scheme in Xcode and click run. Then, without quitting

/// As this is just a sample actor system implementation, it allows itself to be so aggressive about crashing.
/// In a solid implementation one might want to retry connecting and be a bit more lenient or even lazy about
/// connection establishment.
